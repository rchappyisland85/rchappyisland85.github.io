        <p>Hello everyone. I'm YongBin Zhang. Here are some interesting facts about me:</p>
        
        <h2>Video Games Enthusiast</h2>
        
        <p>I have a deep passion for video games and have been a gamer for as long as I can remember. From classic retro games to modern titles, I enjoy exploring virtual worlds and challenging myself in various gaming adventures. It's not just a hobby; it is a part of who I am.</p>
        <h2>Programmer by Day, Gamer by Night</h2>
        <p>During the day, I work as a programmer, crafting code and developing software solutions. It's a challenging and rewarding career that allows me to bring ideas to life. But when the workday is over, I switch into gamer mode, diving into immersive gaming experiences to relax and unwind.</p>

         <p>These two passions might seem quite different, but they both involve problem-solving, creativity, and a love for technology. I find the balance between coding and gaming to be a perfect combination in my life.</p>
